== Cidadao Alerta! (Alert Citizen)

Alert Citizen is a project developed for a Brazilian entrepreneurial contest.
This app was developed along an Android app that allowed users to take mobile picture of social metropolitan issues such as poverty, traffic, infrastructure, and violence

These pictures are geo-located and presented in a UI that would allow government officials to better understand how citizens see their society.
